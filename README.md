Resume Scanner ‚Äî Project Documentation:

üìå 1. Project Overview
In today‚Äôs competitive job market, candidates often apply for multiple roles and must ensure that their resumes align with the job description. Many employers use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that scan resumes for specific keywords to shortlist candidates. Applicants whose resumes lack the right keywords, skills, or relevant experience often do not pass the first screening stage, regardless of their actual capabilities.

The Resume Scanner project addresses this problem. It is an AI-powered web application built with Python, Streamlit, and machine learning tools. It allows users to upload their resume as a PDF file, scans the content, compares it to a given job description, calculates a match percentage, and highlights missing keywords. The result is a clear, actionable report that helps candidates tailor their resumes to match job requirements better, improving their chances of making it through the initial screening process.

üéØ 2. Purpose and Goals
The primary goal of this project is to help job seekers optimize their resumes for a specific job description. By giving instant feedback on keyword matches and relevance, the tool:

Helps applicants improve their chances of passing ATS filters.

Provides immediate insights without needing a career coach or expensive resume-writing services.

Encourages users to tailor each application for the role instead of sending generic resumes.

Familiarizes users with the importance of relevant skills and keywords in modern recruitment.

Demonstrates the practical use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for everyday problems.

‚öôÔ∏è 3. How It Works
The Resume Scanner is designed to be simple yet effective:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Resume:
Users upload their resume as a PDF file through the Streamlit interface.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Extraction:
The app uses PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract raw text from the PDF. PyMuPDF is a fast, lightweight PDF parsing library in Python.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Text Cleaning:
The extracted text is cleaned ‚Äî converted to lowercase, and special characters are removed using Python‚Äôs re module. This ensures that the text is in a uniform format for comparison.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Keyword Matching & Similarity Calculation:
The app uses the TF-IDF Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity from scikit-learn to measure how similar the resume text is to the job description. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) highlights important words by weighing their frequency in the document relative to their overall rarity. Cosine similarity calculates the angle between the TF-IDF vectors of the resume and the job description ‚Äî a common method in NLP to measure how similar two pieces of text are.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Results & Suggestions:
The app displays:

Match Percentage: A clear score out of 100 indicating how well the resume aligns with the job description.

Missing Keywords: A list of keywords present in the job description but missing from the resume. These are displayed as suggestions to help users refine their resumes.

Extracted Resume Text: So users can verify what content was actually scanned.

üìä 8. Detailed Example
Sample Job Description:
‚ÄúWe are looking for a skilled Python developer with experience in machine learning, data analysis, and backend development. Strong knowledge of Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Flask/Django, and REST APIs is required.‚Äù

Sample Resume Text:
Suppose the uploaded resume includes ‚ÄúPython, data analysis, backend API design‚Äù but does not mention scikit-learn or Flask.

The app will:

Extract this text.

Calculate the match percentage (for example, 72%).

Highlight scikit-learn, Flask, Django, REST as missing keywords.

Suggest adding them where relevant.
